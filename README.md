# R_intro--Classic_Boston_Study
An introduction notebook to R using the Boston Housing dataset.

The goal is to discover the basic functions used in R and not to conduct a full in-depth statistics study of the Boston housing dataset.

There are a few packages to install :

```
install.packages("ISLR")
install.packages("car")
```

Other than that, you just need R.
